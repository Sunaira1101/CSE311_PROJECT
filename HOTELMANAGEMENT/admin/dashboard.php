      The hospitality industry includes many career paths and options for those who enjoy interacting with people and providing them with the support they need. One of these options is a career in hotel management, which involves operating and overseeing a hotel location.
      
      Hotel management is an area of the hospitality industry that involves overseeing the operations of a hotel location. When working as a hotel manager, you may manage the operations of a motel, resort or another similar establishment that provides lodging and other services for guests.

      The title, "hotel manager" often refers to a hotel's general manager, who serves as the head executive at a specific property. The duties assigned to the manager depend on the size of the hotel, as well as its purpose and the expectations of its owners. A general manager at a hotel receives support from department heads, who oversee their own employees and report on the key functions.

      Some of the most common departments at a major hotel include the front office or front desk, reservations, housekeeping, revenue, sales and marketing, events and catering, finance, food and beverage, security, human resources and engineering. A career in hotel management may involve working in any of these areas within the industry. In a smaller hotel, the departments may include housekeeping, guest services, engineering, food and beverage, accounts and sales and marketing.

      Working in hotel management often requires you to gain experience in a hotel, whether you are working at the front desk or in housekeeping. Many hotel management professionals work their way up through the industry because the relevant experience is often highly valued in hospitality.

      Some positions may require applicants to hold a Bachelor's Degree in Hospitality Management, Business or another related field, although it depends on the hotel and the requirements of the job. If you want to move up further in the hotel management industry, such as working as a regional vice president or director, you may need a graduate-level degree.  
      
      Hotel management is often mixed up with hospitality management, and the two career paths do share some similarities. Hospitality management includes the full scope of the hospitality industry, such as restaurants, convention centers, cruise ships, country clubs, destination marketing companies and amusement parks, in addition to hotels and other lodging establishments.

      If you want to increase your potential career opportunities, studying hospitality management can benefit you. Those who want to advance their careers in hotel management may also benefit from pursuing a degree in hospitality management.

      A hospitality management program at a higher education institution will prepare its students for working in this fast-paced, growing industry. The curriculum often includes courses focused on accounting, human resource management, administration, public relations, finance, strategy and people management. In some programs, the coursework may also include culinary training.
